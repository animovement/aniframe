# Tests for the circular descriptives

# 1. They agree with the {circular} package, which they replace (#147)
# 2. They are unaffected by where the circle is cut
# 3. Degenerate and empty input behave

# it needs no dependency on it -- this suite exists to stop depending on it.

# direction minimising the summed angular distance, which is the definition.
