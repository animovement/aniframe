\title{Calculate trackball calibration factor}
\usage{
get_trackball_calibration_factor(data, ball_diameter, ball_rotations)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An aniframe object containing x and y coordinates from the
optical flow sensor.}

\item{ball_diameter}{Numeric. The diameter of the trackball in real-world
units (e.g., mm or cm).}

\item{ball_rotations}{Numeric. The number of complete rotations the ball
was rotated during calibration.}
}
\value{
A numeric calibration factor (real distance / measured distance).
Multiply sensor readings by this factor to convert to real-world units.
}
\description{
Computes a calibration factor for converting optical flow sensor units to
real-world distance units. The function compares the known physical distance
traveled by a trackball (based on its diameter and number of rotations) to
the measured distance in sensor units.
}
\details{
The returned calibration factor can be used in \code{set_unit_space}.

The function:
\itemize{
\item Calculates the real distance traveled as circumference Ã— rotations
\item Measures the distance in sensor units using the axis with maximum travel
\item Returns the ratio of real distance to measured distance
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calibrate with a 50mm diameter ball rotated 10 times
cal_factor <- get_trackball_calibration_factor(
  data = sensor_data,
  ball_diameter = 50,
  ball_rotations = 10
)
}
