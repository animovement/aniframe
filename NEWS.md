# anicore (development version)

## Changed

* The order of `variables_what` no longer asserts a hierarchy (#140, #141). It was documented as coarse to fine, which reads naturally for the names that nest — a subject has tracks, a track has keypoints — but identity variables need not nest at all. `sex`, `treatment` and `genotype` partition a population without containing one another, and there is no sense in which one is finer than the next.

  The order is now documented as what auto-detection emits, not something a frame asserts. Nothing should read a position in `variables_what` as meaning a level; a function that needs to know which variable to act on asks for it — `animetric::add_centroid()` takes `across`, `anispace::translate_coords()` takes `level`.

  No behaviour changes. Detection emits the same order, and the order still carries through to column order and grouping, which is presentation: grouping by `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` gives the same groups.

# anicore 0.8.0 (2026-08-28)

## Changed

* **The package is renamed from `aniframe` to `anicore`** (#84). It is no longer one class's home: it declares `aniframe`, `anievent` and — as #84 settles — the types the domain packages build on, while producing almost none of them. A package named after one of its entries was going to keep getting stranger as angles (#83), orientation (#46) and masks (#11) arrive.

  **The `aniframe` class keeps its name**, as do `as_aniframe()`, `is_aniframe()` and every other function. Only the package changes: `library(anicore)`, `anicore::`, and `install.packages("anicore")`.

  Done now rather than at 1.0.0 because a rename only ever gets more expensive, and there are no external users yet to carry the cost.

* `?aniframe` is the constructor again. The package documentation had claimed the same help topic, so the two were merged into one page; it is now `?anicore`.


## Added

* An aniframe can be indexed by a column that is not called `time` (#109). A `variables_index` metadata field names the single column each row is positioned by; `get_index()` reads it, `set_index()` changes it and re-orders the frame, and `as_aniframe()` and `aniframe()` take an `index` argument. A frame has exactly one index, and it is never a grouping variable.

  `set_unit_time()`, `set_sampling_rate()` and `to_anievent()` act on the declared index rather than a column named `time`, and `validate_aniframe()` checks it is present and numeric.

  An `anievent` has no index, since a bout is delimited by `start` and `stop`. Its `variables_index` is `NA` and `get_index()` errors on it.

* `get_sampling_interval()` reports the spacing of the index, derived from the data at construction rather than declared, and `is_sampling_regular()` says whether that spacing is even (#114). Nothing in the stack could previously tell whether a frame was regularly sampled, which several downstream functions need — interpolating on row position rather than on time is only correct when it is.

  Measured per key, since the index restarts in each group and a frame regular within every track can look irregular pooled. Regularity is computed on demand rather than stored, because dropping rows changes the answer; its `tolerance` is an argument, and relative, so floating-point timestamps are not called irregular over the last decimal place.

  `validate_aniframe()` warns when a declared `sampling_rate` disagrees with the measured spacing — the same shape as #98, where the metadata claimed a unit the data was not in.

* `get_sampling_rate()`, `get_unit_space()`, `get_unit_time()` and `get_unit_angle()` read the fields that already had setters (#121). Every field with a dedicated setter now has a dedicated getter, so reading one no longer means naming it as a string. The factor-backed ones return a bare character vector, which is what callers were doing with `as.character()` anyway.

* `get_coordinate_system()` reads the coordinate system a frame is in (#109). There is deliberately no setter: the field is derived from the axis roles, so `set_axes()` says what the columns mean and `anispace`'s `map_to_*()` functions convert the coordinates.

* An `axes` metadata field records which column carries which axis role, so coordinates may be carried by columns of any name (#109). `get_axes()` reads it, `set_axes()` changes it, and `as_aniframe()` and `set_variables_where()` accept the same mapping — `c(x = "u", y = "v")`. `coordinate_system` follows from it, and `set_unit_space()` and the axis extents resolve through it. The roles are a closed set: `x`, `y`, `z`, `rho`, `phi`, `theta`, and one that forms no coordinate system is rejected by name at declaration. Declaring spatial columns without roles keeps its old meaning, the column name being the role.

* Axis directions and extents record how a frame is laid out, replacing `origin` and `y_height` (#124). `axis_directions` maps each axis role to one of `right`, `left`, `up`, `down`, `back` or `forward`, read from where the recording was made; `axis_extents` maps each to how far it runs. `get_axis_directions()`, `set_axis_directions()`, `get_axis_extents()` and `set_axis_extents()` read and write them. Turning an axis to its opposite reflects that column: around the axis extent where one is declared, around zero where none is. The column is found by role, so a frame whose vertical axis is called something else is handled, and an angular frame refuses rather than leaving every stored angle facing the wrong way.

* `get_angle_direction()` says which way angles run, derived from the axis directions rather than recorded (#124). `atan2(y, x)` counts counter-clockwise, so the same physical heading comes out mirrored between a y-down and a y-up frame; nothing said which convention a number was in.

* `get_handedness()` and `set_handedness()` say whether a frame is right- or left-handed (#124). Three declared axis directions determine it and are read in preference to the `handedness` field, which carries the convention for a frame that states one without spelling the axes out. `set_handedness()` defaults to right-handed and completes the third axis when two are declared.

* `set_angle_direction()` asks for a sense of rotation and declares the axis directions that give it (#124), turning the vertical axis over when both are already declared.

* `wrap_angle()` and `unwrap_angle()` move here from `anispace` (#128). They are angle arithmetic rather than coordinate transformation, and belong beside `deg_to_rad()` and `rad_to_deg()`, which were already here. `animetric` re-exported both from `anispace`, which is the sign of a primitive sitting one layer above the packages that need it.

* Turning an axis over on a frame that stores angles recomputes them, rather than refusing (#134). No column carries `x`, `y` or `z` on a polar, cylindrical or spherical frame, but the angles are measured from those axes: turning `x` over takes the supplement of `phi`, turning `y` over negates it, and turning `z` over takes the supplement of `theta`. The result comes back in the unit and range the frame keeps its angles in, and `rho` never moves. An axis with a declared extent still refuses, because reflecting around it would move every point's distance from the origin.

* Every exported function now has a runnable example (#106).

## Changed

* Declaring an axis role that is carried by one column while a different, undeclared column has that role's name now warns (#119). The frame is legal and the mapping is right, but `.data$x` then returns a column that is not the x axis. Silence it with `options(aniframe.quiet = TRUE)`.

* `coordinate_system` follows from which axis roles are declared rather than from column names (#109). A frame whose coordinates are named something else is now inferred correctly, where it degraded to `unknown` and was refused by every spatial function.

* `is_cartesian()`, `is_polar()`, `is_cylindrical()`, `is_spherical()`, the `is_cartesian_*d()` variants and their `ensure_` guards read `coordinate_system` rather than matching column names, and require an aniframe (#107, #109). A frame whose coordinates are called something else now satisfies the predicate for the system it is in, and an undeclared column no longer decides the answer — a spherical frame that has dropped `rho` from its declaration is no longer reported as spherical. The guards say which system the frame is in and how to get to the one you need.

* `add_variables_where()` and `remove_variables_where()` carry the axis roles through (#109). They combined bare column names, so on a frame with declared roles every addition or removal reduced it to `unknown`. Removing an axis until the remainder forms no coordinate system warns rather than aborting; declaring such a set outright still aborts.

* `validate_aniframe()` warns when identity, temporal context and the index together do not name one observation per row (#49). A repeat means some variable that tells the rows apart is undeclared, and every grouped operation folds them together.

* `variables_when` no longer names the column the frame is indexed by; read that from `variables_index`, via `get_index()` (#109). It holds only the temporal context, so a frame with none has `character()` where it had `c("time")`, as does `list_default_metadata()`. `aniprocess::filter_across()` and `filter_na_across()` take `variables_when[1]` as the time column and must swap to `aniframe::get_index()`. Code reading the grouping columns is unaffected, and no longer has anything to exclude: they are `c(variables_what, variables_when)`.

* `default_metadata()` is renamed `list_default_metadata()` (#121).

* `origin` and `y_height` are removed, along with `set_origin()` and `set_y_height()` (#124). Use `set_axis_directions()` and `set_axis_extents()`. `origin` recorded a corner, but the origin is `(0, 0)` in both of its values — what differed was the direction y increases in, which is what is recorded now. It also had nothing to say for 3D data or for a recording with no frame corners at all. The deprecated `point_of_reference` alias goes with the field it aliased.

* `as_aniframe()` no longer fills in an axis extent from the data (#124). `y_height` fell back to `max(y)`, which is the highest tracked point rather than the frame height, so a frame that was never told its height reflected around the wrong place. A frame now declares no extent until given one, and an axis with no extent is negated when turned over rather than reflected around a guess. `aniread`'s readers supply the video height they know about.

* `spec_version` moves to `aniframe = "2.0.0"` and `anievent = "0.3.0"` (#109). Major for `aniframe`: `variables_when` no longer names the index, which breaks a consumer reading it from there. Minor for `anievent`, which gains `variables_index` as `NA`.

## Fixed

* `set_unit_space()` converts the axis extents along with the coordinates (#124). An extent is a length, so converting cm to m left the frame claiming a height in the unit it no longer used.

* `set_unit_space()` converts the length axes of the frame's coordinate system rather than whichever of `x`, `y` and `z` are present (#98). `rho` is a length on polar, cylindrical and spherical frames and was never converted, while the metadata was updated to claim the new unit. Angular axes remain `set_unit_angle()`'s to convert. Where the coordinate system is `unknown` a length cannot be told from an angle, and the function now warns rather than silently converting nothing.

* `set_unit_space()`, `set_unit_angle()`, `set_unit_time()` and `set_sampling_rate()` no longer re-inject a `keypoint` column and overwrite `variables_what` with it (#96). A frame given a custom identity such as `id` was silently regrouped on a constant column.

* `as_aniframe()` keeps the roles a frame already declares rather than re-deriving them, so casting an aniframe is no longer destructive (#96). A declaration whose columns have since been dropped still falls through to detection, so a cast continues to repair a drifted frame.

# aniframe 0.7.0 (2026-08-18)

## Added

* `set_variables_what()`, `set_variables_when()`, `set_variables_where()` and `set_variables_event()` declare the variable roles, each with `get_`, `add_` and `remove_` verbs (#82). They declare the role *and* restructure the frame to match, so the metadata and the frame cannot drift apart. `add_variables_*()` appends, so adding one identity column no longer means restating the others.

* `validate_aniframe()` re-checks that the metadata still describes the frame: every declared column present, `time` and the spatial columns numeric (#79). Counterpart to `validate_anievent()`.

* `is_spatial()` and `ensure_is_spatial()` test the columns named in `variables_where`, which the `is_cartesian*()` family does not — those look at column names only (#79).

## Changed

* `set_metadata()` no longer writes the `variables_*` fields; use their dedicated setters (#82). Writing them as plain metadata left the frame typed, ordered and grouped as before, so operations silently integrated across identities. A complete metadata object can still be restored wholesale.

* `as_aniframe()` errors when `variables_what` names a column that is not in the data, as it already did for `variables_when` and `variables_where` (#77).

* `aniframe` and `anievent` recognise the same identity variables — `model`, `individual`, `subject`, `track`, `keypoint` — ordered coarse to fine (#77).

* `spec_version` moves to `aniframe = "1.1.0"` and `anievent = "0.2.0"`.

## Removed

* `as_aniframe()` no longer adds a `keypoint = "centroid"` column to data that already has an identity column (#77). Results are unaffected — the column was constant — but it no longer appears in the frame or the print header.

## Fixed

* Downstream subclasses survive the class-preserving methods (#81). `animetric`'s `aniframe_kin` was dropped by the first `filter()`, `mutate()` or `[`. Verbs that were never covered — `distinct()`, joins, `bind_rows()` — still drop it.

* An `anievent` no longer claims spatial properties it cannot have, such as a BORIS export announcing `origin: bottom_left` (#73). `unit_angle`, `origin` and `reference_frame` gain a `"none"` level.

# aniframe 0.6.0 (2026-06-24)

## Added

* `anievent`, a class for behavioural events in long format — one row per bout (state event) or instant (point event) (#67). A sibling of `aniframe`: it shares the metadata substrate but does not inherit from it. Required columns are `channel`, `type`, `label`, `start` and `stop`, with identity columns travelling via `variables_what` and an optional `modifiers` list-column. `type` is derived per `(channel, label)` group at construction — a group is `"point"` only when all its bouts are instantaneous — and can be set explicitly where that misclassifies.

* `anievent()` and `as_anievent()` construct the class, `is_anievent()` and `ensure_is_anievent()` test it, and `validate_anievent()` re-checks its invariants on demand (#68). Class-preserving dplyr and base-R methods keep the class through tidyverse pipelines.

* `to_anievent()` run-length-encodes per-frame data into bouts, as distinct from `as_anievent()`, which casts data that is already bout-shaped. Methods for `data.frame` and `aniframe`; the latter auto-detects each channel's identity scope, so a label constant across keypoints does not produce a duplicate bout per keypoint.

* A `variables_event` metadata field — a named list `list(state, point)` declaring which columns hold per-frame event labels (#66). State columns are interval-valued, point columns instantaneous; both appear in the print header when populated.

* A `spec_version` metadata field, keyed by class, so each class's data contract can evolve independently of the package version (#65). Older serialised objects without it continue to validate.

* `set_unit_time()` and `set_sampling_rate()` are S3 generics with `aniframe` and `anievent` methods. On an anievent the calibration factor applies to `start` and `stop` rather than `time`.

* `as_aniframe()` auto-detects `observation` as a temporal grouping column, alongside `session` and `trial`.

* New article, "The anievent data structure", covering channels, state and point events, modifiers, validation and multi-observation data (#70).

## Changed

* `validate_anievent()` warns when two bouts of the same `channel` overlap within a group. A warning rather than an error: overlap is normal BORIS output and the long format handles it natively.

* `set_metadata()` accepts partial `variables_event` input — supplying only `state` or only `point` is fine, and `NA` or empty entries read as "none" rather than erroring (#76).

* The metadata print heading reads "animovement metadata", since the substrate is shared by both classes (#69). The S3 class name is unchanged.

# aniframe 0.5.0 (2026-05-04)

## Added

* `set_origin()` converts between the `bottom_left` and `top_left` origin conventions, reflecting `y` around the recorded frame height (#52).

* `set_y_height()` sets the y-axis frame height that `set_origin()` uses, validated against the data range, and a `y_height` metadata field to hold it. Readers populate it from the source; `as_aniframe()` falls back to `max(y)` when missing, and never overwrites an existing value.

* A `connections` metadata field for skeletons and other variable-level networks (#6). Stored as a named list keyed by the relevant identity or temporal variable — typically `keypoint`, but `individual` for social networks — with each entry a 2-column `from`/`to` tibble whose order is preserved. Manage it with `set_connections()`, `get_connections()`, `add_connections()` and `remove_connections()`. Endpoints missing from the corresponding column warn but are kept.

* A "Time" row in the print summary showing the tracked interval as `HH:MM:SS to HH:MM:SS`, or as absolute datetimes when `start_datetime` is set (#50). Sub-second runs use millisecond precision.

* New articles introducing the data structure: "The aniframe data structure", "Metadata on an aniframe" and "Connections".

## Changed

* `set_unit_angle()` converts the spatial angular columns `phi` and `theta` whenever they are present, so polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates stay consistent with the declared `unit_angle` (#21). These were previously assumed to be radians and left alone. The signature becomes `set_unit_angle(data, to_unit, cols = NULL)`, matching `set_unit_time()`; pass `cols` only for additional non-spatial angular columns. Positional callers need to swap their arguments.

* The print summary is driven by `variables_what` and `variables_when` rather than hard-coded column names (#51). Custom identity and temporal variables such as `track` and `model` now appear, rows are omitted when their column is absent, and single-track readers no longer emit "Unknown or uninitialised column: `individual`".

* The metadata print renders as a single block with field names and values aligned in fixed-width columns (#48).

* The `filename` metadata field accepts a character vector of length one or more, for readers that load from multiple source files (#34).

* Renamed the `point_of_reference` metadata field to `origin`, with permitted values `"bottom_left"` and `"top_left"`.

## Deprecated

* `point_of_reference` as a metadata field name. `set_metadata()` still accepts it, with a warning.

## Fixed

* `as_aniframe()` no longer mis-classifies cylindrical (`rho`, `phi`, `z`) and spherical (`rho`, `phi`, `theta`) data as Cartesian (#44). Detection recognises the `rho` + `phi` signature first, so cylindrical data is no longer reduced to `cartesian_1d` by its `z` column. Cylindrical spatial columns are now ordered `rho`, `phi`, `z` (#43).

# aniframe 0.4.1

## Fixed

* Corrected metadata written by `as_aniframe()`.

# aniframe 0.4.0

## Added

* `variables_what`, `variables_when` and `variables_where` arguments to `as_aniframe()` and `example_aniframe()`, written into the frame's metadata. These declare which columns carry identity, temporal position and spatial position, and are the basis for how the frame is typed, ordered and grouped.

## Changed

* Identity and temporal variables are coerced to integer, with the exception of `time`, which stays numeric.
* `time` is required. A frame without it is no longer a valid aniframe.
* An unrecognised set of spatial columns is accepted, with `coordinate_system` recorded as `"unknown"`, rather than refused.

# aniframe 0.3.5

## Added

* A `NEWS.md` file, to track changes to the package.
* Smaller units: `ns` (nanosecond), `us` (microsecond), `nm` (nanometre) and `um` (micrometre).

## Removed

* `get_trackball_calibration_factor()`, following the move of trackball handling to aniread.

# aniframe 0.3.4

## Removed

* Trackball calibration. It reads hardware output rather than describing a frame, and belongs with the readers in aniread.

# aniframe 0.3.3

## Fixed

* `NA` and `NaN` handling in metadata and coercion.
* An `NA` datetime is no longer given a class, which had made empty `start_datetime` values print oddly.

# aniframe 0.3.2

## Changed

* `"cartesian"` is no longer a permitted `coordinate_system` value; the dimensioned forms `cartesian_1d`, `cartesian_2d` and `cartesian_3d` replace it.
* Metadata printing and the `start_datetime` class were tidied.

# aniframe 0.3.1

## Removed

* `add_centroid()`. Deriving a centroid is a metric rather than a property of the frame, and belongs in animetric.

# aniframe 0.3.0

Spatial transformations leave aniframe for [anispace](https://github.com/animovement/anispace). aniframe keeps the coordinate *system* — what a frame is in, and how to test it — while converting between systems becomes anispace's job.

## Added

* `ensure_is_cartesian()`, with `_1d()`, `_2d()` and `_3d()` variants, and `ensure_is_polar()`, `ensure_is_cylindrical()` and `ensure_is_spherical()` — guards to sit at the top of a function that requires a particular coordinate system.
* `convert_nan_to_na()` is exported.

## Removed

* The coordinate transformations `map_to_cartesian()`, `map_to_polar()`, `map_to_cylindrical()` and `map_to_spherical()`, the component converters `cartesian_to_rho()`, `cartesian_to_phi()`, `cartesian_to_theta()`, `polar_to_x()`, `polar_to_y()` and `spherical_to_z()`, the rigid transforms `rotate_coords()`, `translate_coords()` and `transform_to_egocentric()`, and the angle helpers `wrap_angle()`, `unwrap_angle()`, `diff_angle()` and `calculate_angular_difference()`. All are available from anispace.

# aniframe 0.2.5

## Fixed

* `map_to_cartesian()` no longer adds a `z` column when converting from polar coordinates.

# aniframe 0.2.4

## Changed

* `set_metadata()` accepts a partial metadata list, rather than requiring every field.

# aniframe 0.2.3

## Added

* `is_cartesian()`, with `_1d()`, `_2d()` and `_3d()` variants, and `is_polar()`, `is_cylindrical()` and `is_spherical()` to test a frame's coordinate system.

## Changed

* `model` is recognised as an identity column, alongside `individual` and `keypoint`.

# aniframe 0.2.2

## Added

* `unwrap_angle()`, the counterpart to `wrap_angle()`.

## Changed

* `constrain_angles_radians()` is renamed `wrap_angle()`.

# aniframe 0.2.1

## Added

* Unit handling: `set_unit_space()`, `set_unit_angle()`, `set_unit_time()` and `set_sampling_rate()`.
* Coordinate transformations: `map_to_cartesian()`, `map_to_polar()`, `map_to_cylindrical()` and `map_to_spherical()`, with the component converters `cartesian_to_rho()`, `cartesian_to_phi()`, `cartesian_to_theta()`, `polar_to_x()`, `polar_to_y()` and `spherical_to_z()`.
* Rigid transformations: `rotate_coords()`, `translate_coords()` and `transform_to_egocentric()`.
* Angle handling: `deg_to_rad()`, `rad_to_deg()`, `constrain_angles_radians()`, `calculate_angular_difference()` and `diff_angle()`.
* `ensure_is_aniframe()`, a guard for functions that require an aniframe.
* Trackball calibration, via `get_trackball_calibration_factor()`.

# aniframe 0.2.0 (2025-10-23)

## Changed

* `tbl_sum.aniframe()` is registered as an S3 method rather than exported.

# aniframe 0.1.0 (2025-10-13)

First release. aniframe provides the core data structure for the animovement suite: a tibble subclass carrying metadata that says which columns hold identity, time and position.

## Added

* `aniframe()` and `as_aniframe()` to construct a frame, `is_aniframe()` to test one, and `example_aniframe()` to generate one.
* `get_metadata()`, `set_metadata()` and `default_metadata()` to read and write the metadata a frame carries.
