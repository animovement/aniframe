# Convert a data frame to aniframe

Convert a data frame to aniframe

## Usage

``` r
as_aniframe(
  data,
  metadata = list(),
  variables_what = NULL,
  variables_when = NULL,
  variables_where = NULL,
  index = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame with movement data.

- metadata:

  A list of metadata to attach to the aniframe.

- variables_what:

  Character vector of identity columns that together define a unique
  entity, and which the frame is grouped by. If `NULL` (the default),
  detected from the data: whichever of `model`, `individual`, `subject`,
  `track` and `keypoint` are present, in the order
  [`list_recognised_variables_what()`](https://animovement.dev/anicore/reference/list_recognised_variables_what.md)
  lists them. Order carries no meaning of its own — see its
  documentation. An aniframe needs at least one identity variable, so if
  none of them is found, a `keypoint` column is added with the value
  `"centroid"`. Pass `character(0)` to declare no identity variables at
  all — a deliberate opt-out, which leaves the frame ungrouped. Every
  column named here must exist in `data`.

- variables_when:

  Character vector of temporal columns that together define a unique
  timepoint. If `NULL` (the default), detected from the data: whichever
  of `observation`, `session`, `trial` and `time` are present, minus the
  index. These are the temporal *context* — which session, which trial —
  and, together with `variables_what`, they are what the frame is
  grouped by. The index itself is declared separately and is never one
  of them.

- variables_where:

  The spatial columns that together define position. Either a plain
  character vector of column names, in which case the name is taken to
  be the axis role, or a vector named by axis role —
  `c(x = "u", y = "v")` — which lets the columns be called anything. The
  roles themselves are a closed set (`x`, `y`, `z`, `rho`, `phi`,
  `theta`), so that transformations between coordinate systems stay well
  defined; an unrecognised role is rejected by name. If `NULL` (the
  default), detected from the data.

- index:

  Length-one character vector naming the column the frame is indexed by
  — the position of each row within its temporal context. It is never a
  grouping variable. If `NULL` (the default), the frame's existing
  declaration is kept, or `"time"` for a frame that has none. The column
  must exist and be numeric; it may be called anything.

## Value

An aniframe object

## Examples

``` r
df <- data.frame(
  time = 1:3, individual = 'a', keypoint = 'centroid',
  x = c(0, 1, 2), y = c(0, 1, 0)
)
as_aniframe(df)
#> # Individuals: a
#> # Keypoints:   centroid
#>   individual keypoint  time     x     y
#>   <fct>      <fct>    <int> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 a          centroid     1     0     0
#> 2 a          centroid     2     1     1
#> 3 a          centroid     3     2     0
```
