# Create an aniframe data frame

Creates a specialized data frame for movement data with columns defining
entity identity, timepoints, and spatial position.

## Usage

``` r
aniframe(
  ...,
  metadata = list(),
  variables_what = NULL,
  variables_when = NULL,
  variables_where = NULL,
  index = NULL,
  .rows = NULL,
  .name_repair = c("check_unique", "unique", "universal", "minimal")
)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Name-value pairs to create columns in the data frame.

- metadata:

  Optional list of metadata.

- variables_what:

  Character vector of identity columns that together define a unique
  entity, and which the frame is grouped by. If `NULL` (the default),
  detected from the data: whichever of `model`, `individual`, `subject`,
  `track` and `keypoint` are present, in the order
  [`list_recognised_variables_what()`](https://animovement.dev/anicore/reference/list_recognised_variables_what.md)
  lists them. Order carries no meaning of its own — see its
  documentation. An aniframe needs at least one identity variable, so if
  none of them is found, a `keypoint` column is added with the value
  `"centroid"`. Pass `character(0)` to declare no identity variables at
  all — a deliberate opt-out, which leaves the frame ungrouped. Every
  column named here must exist in `data`.

- variables_when:

  Character vector of temporal columns that together define a unique
  timepoint. If `NULL` (the default), detected from the data: whichever
  of `observation`, `session`, `trial` and `time` are present, minus the
  index. These are the temporal *context* — which session, which trial —
  and, together with `variables_what`, they are what the frame is
  grouped by. The index itself is declared separately and is never one
  of them.

- variables_where:

  The spatial columns that together define position. Either a plain
  character vector of column names, in which case the name is taken to
  be the axis role, or a vector named by axis role —
  `c(x = "u", y = "v")` — which lets the columns be called anything. The
  roles themselves are a closed set (`x`, `y`, `z`, `rho`, `phi`,
  `theta`), so that transformations between coordinate systems stay well
  defined; an unrecognised role is rejected by name. If `NULL` (the
  default), detected from the data.

- index:

  Length-one character vector naming the column the frame is indexed by
  — the position of each row within its temporal context. It is never a
  grouping variable. If `NULL` (the default), the frame's existing
  declaration is kept, or `"time"` for a frame that has none. The column
  must exist and be numeric; it may be called anything.

- .rows:

  Number of rows (passed to tibble).

- .name_repair:

  How to repair column names (passed to tibble).

## Value

An aniframe object (tibble with aniframe class).
