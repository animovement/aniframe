#' Say whether the frame is right- or left-handed
#'
#' @description
#' Handedness is what 3D data is usually described by, so this says it
#' directly rather than through three separate axis directions.
#'
#' With two axes declared the third follows, and is recorded. With all three
#' declared, turning the handedness over reverses the **depth** axis — the one
#' pointing `back` or `forward` — and reflects that column, which is the
#' conventional way to convert between the two.
#'
#' Right-handed is the convention across the suite, so `set_handedness(data)`
#' completes a frame the standard way. It is not assumed of a frame that has
#' not been asked: which side a recording was made from is a fact about the
#' recording, and [get_handedness()] reports `"unknown"` until it is told.
#'
#' @param data An aniframe object.
#' @param handedness Either `"right"` or `"left"`. Right-handed is the
#'   convention across the suite and the default here; a frame is only
#'   left-handed if it is told to be.
#'
#' @return The aniframe, with the axis directions that give this handedness
#'   and the depth axis reflected if it had to turn over.
#'
#' @details
#' Two axes cannot fix a handedness, so at least two must already be declared
#' for the third to follow from this one. Declare them with
#' [set_axis_directions()].
