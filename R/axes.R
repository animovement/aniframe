# Axis roles (#109)
#
# The coordinate system used to be inferred by matching `variables_where`
# against a fixed list of names. The name *was* the role, so a frame whose
# coordinates were called anything else degraded to `unknown` and every
# spatial function refused it.
#
# The `axes` field maps role to column instead: `c(x = "u", y = "v")`. The
# set of roles stays closed — that is what makes `map_to_polar()` and unit
# conversion meaningful — while the spelling of the columns is free.
#
# It is a field of its own rather than names on `variables_where`, which
# stays a plain vector. A named character vector is a *rename instruction*
# to tidyselect, and `variables_where` is read raw and passed to
# `dplyr::all_of()` downstream, where names would silently rename the
# columns. `axes` will move into the spatial category in #118.

#' The axis role sets that define each coordinate system
#'
#' Closed by design. A transformation between coordinate systems is only
#' well defined because the roles on each side are known, so an
#' unrecognised role is rejected rather than accommodated.

#' @return Named list mapping a comma-separated sorted role set to the
#'   coordinate system it defines.
