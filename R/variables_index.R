# The index (#109)
#
# `variables_when` used to do two jobs at once: name the column the frame
# is indexed by, and name the surrounding temporal context. The two were
# told apart by the literal string "time", which forced every frame to
# have a column of that name and made the distinction unrecoverable
# downstream without repeating the same literal.
#
# `variables_index` names the column instead, and is kept out of
# `variables_when` entirely, so that field is exactly what the frame
# groups by. Making it a member would leave `set_index()` promoting the
# old index to a grouping variable, and every downstream package
# repeating the same `setdiff` to undo it.

#' The column an aniframe is indexed by
#'
#' Exactly one column, of any name, holding the position of each row
#' within its temporal context. It is declared separately from
#' `variables_when`, which holds the context itself — session, trial,
#' observation — and which, with `variables_what`, is what the frame is
#' grouped by. The index is never a grouping variable.
#'
#' An [anievent()] has none: a bout spans an interval rather than sitting
#' at a point, so it is delimited by `start` and `stop`, which are
#' declared temporal columns. Its `variables_index` is `NA`, and asking
#' for it here is an error rather than a guess.
#'
#' @param data An aniframe object.
#'
#' @return Length-one character vector naming the index column.
#'
#' @examples
#' af <- example_aniframe(n_obs = 3, n_individuals = 1, n_keypoints = 1)
#' get_index(af)
#'
#' @seealso [set_index()] to change it, [get_variables_when()] for the
#'   full set of temporal columns.

#' Resolve the index from a metadata list
#'
#' Objects serialised before the field existed have no `index`. They were
#' built when a literal `time` column was mandatory, so that is what they
#' are indexed by, and defaulting here keeps them working untouched.
#'
#' `NA` — how an [anievent()] spells "not applicable" — falls back the
#' same way. The only path that reaches here with anievent metadata is a
#' cast to [aniframe()], which needs *some* index; [get_index()] refuses
#' the anievent before it gets this far.

#' Declare which column an aniframe is indexed by
#'
#' Changing the index changes the order the rows come in, so — like the
#' `variables_*` declarations — it is not reachable through
#' [set_metadata()] and has its own setter, which does the restructuring
#' too.
#'
#' If the column was declared as temporal context it stops being so: a
#' variable cannot be both the position within a context and part of it.
#' The column the frame was previously indexed by becomes an ordinary
#' undeclared column rather than being promoted to a grouping variable —
#' which, holding one value per row, would put every row in its own
#' group.
#'
#' @param data An aniframe object.
#' @param column Length-one character vector naming the index column. It
#'   must exist in `data` and be numeric.
