# The anievent data structure

``` r

library(aniframe)
```

## At a glance

An `anievent` is the sibling of
[`aniframe`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/articles/aniframe-structure.md)
for **behavioural events**: sleep bouts, vocalisations, manual scoring
from BORIS, the output of segmentation models.

Each row is one **event**. An event sits in a **channel** (where it is,
as a soft convention, mutually exclusive with other events on the same
channel), has a **type** — either `"state"` (durative) or `"point"`
(instant) — and carries a **label** identifying which event it is. Each
event has a **start** and a **stop** time (identical for point events).
Just like an `aniframe`, the event is *performed by something* (identity
columns, declared via `variables_what`) at *some time*
(temporal-grouping columns, declared via `variables_when`).

The class is a true sibling — it does **not** inherit from `aniframe`,
but it shares the metadata substrate, so
[`get_metadata()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/get_metadata.md),
[`set_metadata()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/set_metadata.md),
and the rest of the metadata API work on both.

## Channels

A **channel** is a single mutually-exclusive categorical track of
behaviour. Within one channel, a subject can carry only one label at a
time: a sleep-state channel is either `REM` or `wake`, never both
simultaneously. If two behaviours **can** co-occur — say grooming while
walking — they belong on **separate channels**, not as two values of the
same channel. That mutual-exclusivity constraint is what makes a channel
a channel.

This means how you design your channels is a modelling choice. BORIS
calls them “behavioural categories” in the ethogram; segmentation
pipelines call them “label streams”; we call them channels in this
package.

## Anatomy at a glance

``` r

ae <- anievent(
  individual = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 2L),
  channel = c("behaviour", "behaviour", "call", "behaviour"),
  label =c("REM", "wake", "alarm", "REM"),
  start = c(3, 14, 4.5, 1),
  stop = c(9, 19, 4.5, 6)
)
ae
#> # anievent:       4 × 6
#> # Individuals:    1, 2
#> # Event channels: behaviour, call
#> # Event types:    3 state, 1 point
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct>
#> 1          1   3     9   behaviour state REM  
#> 2          1   4.5   4.5 call      point alarm
#> 3          1  14    19   behaviour state wake 
#> 4          2   1     6   behaviour state REM
```

Two things to spot:

1.  The **header rows** prefixed with `#` come from the metadata
    attribute — identity columns and the event channels carried by the
    `channel` column.
2.  The **data columns** are the long-format event records: one row per
    bout (or instant), with the channel name in `channel` and the label
    in `label`.

## Required schema

An `anievent` has five mandatory columns plus identity columns that
travel via `variables_what`:

| Column | Type | Required? | Role |
|----|----|----|----|
| `channel` | character | yes | which event channel |
| `type` | factor | yes | `"state"` (durative) or `"point"` (instant) |
| `label` | factor | yes | which event (the categorical label) |
| `start` | numeric | yes | bout start (or instant) |
| `stop` | numeric | yes | bout stop (equals `start` for point events) |
| identity | as source | optional | e.g. `individual`, `track`, `subject` |
| `modifiers` | list-column of `character` | optional | flat per-event modifier values |

Identity columns are auto-detected from a known list (`model`,
`individual`, `subject`, `track`, `keypoint`) — the same list `aniframe`
uses, so identity means the same thing on both sides — or you can supply
any name via `variables_what`. An `anievent` with no identity column at
all is fine for single-subject experiments.

`type` is auto-derived from `start`/`stop` at construction.
Classification is **per `(channel, label)` group**, not per row: a group
is labelled `"point"` only when *all* of its bouts have `start == stop`.
If even one bout in the group is durative, the whole group is `"state"`
— so the same behaviour stays consistently typed across its occurrences.
Pass `type` explicitly to override this default.

### Multiple observations / trials / sessions

Behavioural coding often spans several clips or trials, each with its
own time origin (`start = 0` means “the start of *this* clip”, not “the
start of the experiment”). To carry that context, add an `observation`,
`session`, or `trial` column — those three names are auto-detected into
`variables_when` alongside `start` and `stop`, and the column is coerced
to factor / integer the same way aniframe does it:

``` r

ae_multi <- anievent(
  individual = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L),
  observation = c("clip_a", "clip_a", "clip_b", "clip_b"),
  channel =c("behaviour", "behaviour", "behaviour", "behaviour"),
  label =c("REM", "wake", "REM", "wake"),
  start = c(3, 14, 1, 7),
  stop = c(9, 19, 5, 12)
)
get_metadata(ae_multi, "variables_when")
#> [1] "observation" "start"       "stop"
ae_multi
#> # anievent:       4 × 7
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour
#> # Event types:    4 state
#>   individual observation start  stop channel   type  label
#>        <int> <fct>       <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct>
#> 1          1 clip_a          3     9 behaviour state REM  
#> 2          1 clip_a         14    19 behaviour state wake 
#> 3          1 clip_b          1     5 behaviour state REM  
#> 4          1 clip_b          7    12 behaviour state wake
```

The `start`/`stop` values are local to each observation — both clips
have an event starting near the beginning, but those are separate
moments in real time. Anything downstream that needs to combine clips
onto a shared timeline (plots, cross-clip metrics) will need an
observation-level offset table; the class itself just carries the key.

### Time unit

`unit_time` is carried in the shared metadata substrate, so an
`anievent` declares the unit of its `start`/`stop` values just like an
`aniframe` declares the unit of its `time` column (`"frame"`, `"ms"`,
`"s"`, `"m"`, `"h"`, …).
[`set_unit_time()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/set_unit_time.md)
and
[`set_sampling_rate()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/set_sampling_rate.md)
dispatch on both classes — on an anievent they scale `start` and `stop`
instead of `time`:

``` r

ae_frames <- anievent(
  individual = 1L,
  channel = c("behaviour", "behaviour"),
  label =c("REM", "wake"),
  start = c(30, 150),
  stop = c(60, 300)
)
ae_seconds <- set_sampling_rate(ae_frames, sampling_rate = 30)
ae_seconds
#> # anievent:       2 × 6
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour
#> # Event types:    2 state
#> # Sampling rate:  30 Hz
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct>
#> 1          1     1     2 behaviour state REM  
#> 2          1     5    10 behaviour state wake
```

## State vs point events

Two temporal kinds:

- **State events** — interval-valued, durative (`stop > start`). A sleep
  bout, a grooming bout.
- **Point events** — instantaneous (`stop == start`). A startle, a
  vocalisation onset.

The `anievent` class is intentionally **type-agnostic**: it does not
require you to declare which channels are state and which are point. The
`channel` column already names the channels, and the duration of each
row tells you everything the class needs.

Type only becomes load-bearing at conversion / plotting / metric time:

- when converting an `anievent` to a per-frame `aniframe` (so the
  conversion knows whether to fill the whole interval or just a single
  frame),
- when plotting (state → coloured band; point → marker),
- when computing metrics that differ by type.

Those operations live in companion packages (`animetric`, `anivis`) and
will accept type declarations at call time. The metadata field
`variables_event = list(state = ..., point = ...)` exists on the shared
metadata substrate for callers that want to record the distinction
explicitly, but the `anievent` class itself does not enforce it.

## Modifiers

A **modifier** is a per-event attribute set at coding time — in BORIS,
the values chosen from a behaviour’s modifier sets. A grooming bout
might carry the values `"limb"` and `"whisker"`; an alarm call might
carry `"high"`.

Modifiers are stored as an optional `modifiers` list-column, where each
cell is a **flat character vector** (length zero, one, or many). This
matches how BORIS exports modifier data: the set-to-value structure from
the ethogram is collapsed into a single bag of values per event, so a
modifier cell is just the values picked, with no set-key wrapping.

``` r

ae_with_mods <- anievent(
  individual = c(1L, 1L, 1L),
  channel =c("behaviour", "behaviour", "call"),
  label =c("REM", "REM", "alarm"),
  start = c(3, 14, 4.5),
  stop = c(9, 19, 4.5),
  modifiers = list(
    c("limb", "whisker"),
    "tail",
    character()
  )
)
ae_with_mods
#> # anievent:       3 × 7
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour, call
#> # Event types:    2 state, 1 point
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label modifiers
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct> <list>   
#> 1          1   3     9   behaviour state REM   <chr [2]>
#> 2          1   4.5   4.5 call      point alarm <chr [0]>
#> 3          1  14    19   behaviour state REM   <chr [1]>
```

Standard dplyr verbs round-trip the list-column without further
ceremony:

``` r

ae_with_mods |>
  dplyr::filter(channel == "behaviour")
#> # anievent:       2 × 7
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour
#> # Event types:    2 state
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label modifiers
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct> <list>   
#> 1          1     3     9 behaviour state REM   <chr [2]>
#> 2          1    14    19 behaviour state REM   <chr [1]>
```

A helper to widen this list-column into one logical column per distinct
modifier value (so filtering or faceting on a single modifier value is
straightforward) is planned but not yet implemented.

## Validation

[`validate_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/validate_anievent.md)
re-checks the structural invariants on demand, returning the input
invisibly on success and erroring otherwise:

``` r

# Happy path: returns invisibly, no output
validate_anievent(ae_with_mods)

# Negative interval is caught
bad <- ae_with_mods
bad$stop[1] <- bad$start[1] - 1
validate_anievent(bad)
#> Error in `ensure_anievent_intervals_nonnegative()`:
#> ! stop must be greater than or equal to start for every row.
#> ✖ Row violating the invariant: 1.
```

The validator confirms required columns are present with the right
types, that `stop >= start` for every row, and that any `modifiers`
column is well-formed. It deliberately does **not** check type-linked
invariants (e.g. point rows having `start == stop`) — those belong to
the conversion code that knows which channels are typed as what.

## Encoding per-frame data into an `anievent`

Per-frame data (factor / character / logical columns over a time grid)
is encoded into the bout shape with
[`to_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/to_anievent.md).
The verb is distinct from
[`as_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/as_anievent.md):
that one is a *strict cast* of an already-bout-shaped data frame (with
`channel` / `type` / `label` / `start` / `stop`);
[`to_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/to_anievent.md)
*produces* that shape via run-length encoding.

### From a data frame

[`to_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/to_anievent.md)
on a data frame takes bare-name selections for the event columns and the
time / identity context.

``` r

library(tibble)
df <- tibble(
  individual = 1L,
  time       = 1:8,
  behaviour  = factor(c("REM", "REM", "REM", "wake", "wake", "REM", "REM", NA)),
  woke_up    = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
  call       = c(NA, "alarm", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
)

to_anievent(
  df,
  time           = time,
  state          = c(behaviour, woke_up),
  point          = call,
  variables_what = individual
)
#> # anievent:       5 × 6
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour, call, woke_up
#> # Event types:    4 state, 1 point
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label  
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct>  
#> 1          1     1     3 behaviour state REM    
#> 2          1     2     2 call      point alarm  
#> 3          1     4     5 behaviour state wake   
#> 4          1     4     4 woke_up   state woke_up
#> 5          1     6     7 behaviour state REM
```

Three things to notice:

- `behaviour` is a multi-level factor → one channel with both `REM` and
  `wake` labels, RLE’d into contiguous bouts.
- `woke_up` is a logical → TRUE-runs become bouts labelled `"woke_up"`
  (the column name); FALSE frames produce nothing.
- `call` is a sparse factor passed to `point` → one bout per non-`NA`
  frame with `start == stop`.

The channel name always comes from the column name. Use `state` vs
`point` to pick how the column is interpreted — the value-shape (factor
/ character / logical) is handled internally.

### From an `aniframe`

If you already have an `aniframe` with `variables_event` declared in
metadata,
[`to_anievent()`](http://animovement.dev/aniframe/reference/to_anievent.md)
reads everything from there:

``` r

af <- aniframe(
  individual = rep(1L, 8),
  time = 1:8,
  x = 1:8,
  y = 1:8,
  behaviour = factor(
    c("REM", "REM", "REM", "wake", "wake", "REM", "REM", NA),
    levels = c("REM", "wake")
  )
)
af <- set_metadata(
  af,
  variables_event = list(state = "behaviour", point = character())
)
to_anievent(af)
#> # anievent:       3 × 6
#> # Individuals:    1
#> # Event channels: behaviour
#> # Event types:    3 state
#>   individual start  stop channel   type  label
#>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <fct> <fct>
#> 1          1     1     3 behaviour state REM  
#> 2          1     4     5 behaviour state wake 
#> 3          1     6     7 behaviour state REM
```

The resulting anievent inherits `unit_time` and `sampling_rate` from the
host. `stop` is the time of the last frame of each bout (inclusive,
frame-aligned). If a `<col>_modifiers` list-column is present alongside
an event column, its cells are gathered into the anievent’s `modifiers`
column, one entry per emitted bout.

The reverse direction (`anievent` → `aniframe`) is intentionally not
provided yet — the anievent’s loose mutual-exclusion semantics don’t map
onto an aniframe’s per-frame columns without a design decision about how
to resolve overlap, and that design is still pending.
